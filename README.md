# webScraper
a small rust web scraper

this is a small rust web scraper that is simply ran by using build run.  This was an aside to my main project, the Alexa Skill.  Unfortunately
I'm currently running into issues with one of the crates that I can't resolve at the moment so it does not build.

when working, this scraper scraped sports data from a website and placed it into a player struct that was intended to be used with the 
Alexa Skill.  When time permits I plan on resolving these issues to make the alexa skill much more robust.
